1. At first you need to create a folder and, inside that folder create a virtual environment.
    To create virtual enviornment, type `virtualenv venv` in command line.

2. After that, you need to activate your environment using `source venv/Scripts/activate`, for windows.

3. After activating, install necessary libraries or modules by `pip install "package name"`

NOTE: DO NOT EVER, I REPEAT NEVER change your main folder name after you create virtual emvironment.
Your venv will stop working but somehow still gets activated when you activate it.
You might be able to run your python programs but you will have to reinstall all necessary packages. 

Thank You....
